### Day-1 (30 July 2025)
The day began woth the blessings of of almight Shri Guru Granth Sahib ji .All the students gathered in the Gurudwara Sahib of the college. There was Shabad Kirtan and Japji Sahib Path. After taking the blessings,we went to have snacks which were suprisingly quite tasty.After that all were sent to auditorium where we got your welcome package. All the branches were present in the auditorium. The induction began and we welcomed our chief guest Mr.Maheshinder Singh Grewal. The first day was quite different for me amd completely opposite to my thoughts
